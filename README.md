# Features-mapping-using-Two-Frame-Structure-from-motion-and-AI-detection
Program developed for the thesis 'Features mapping using Two-Frame Structure from motion and AI detection'

What is presented on this page is the program developed for the thesis. 
In order to test it one has to open it up on colab and create a copy wich they can modify.
To make it work one must load into the colab fyle system the yolov9 directory found on this page, a directory containing a set of pictures taken along a path, best if one every meter without changing too much the orientation and finally a set of pictures of checkerboard pattern taken with the same camera for calibration, if it does not work at first add more photos.
Before executing the cells the last two need to be filled up with the paths to the files required.

The yolov9 directory was downloaded from https://github.com/SkalskiP/yolov9.git and custom trained on the dataset https://universe.roboflow.com/asu-z7wy9/80-train.
